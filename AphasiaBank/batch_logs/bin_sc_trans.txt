[W socket.cpp:558] [c10d] The client socket cannot be initialized to connect to [localhost]:38483 (errno: 97 - Address family not supported by protocol).
Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft were not used when initializing HubertModel: ['lm_head.bias', 'lm_head.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing HubertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing HubertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

This flag results in an extra traversal of the autograd graph every iteration,  which can adversely affect performance. If your model indeed never has any unused parameters in the forward pass, consider turning this flag off. Note that this warning may be a false positive if your model has flow control causing later iterations to have unused parameters. (function operator())
